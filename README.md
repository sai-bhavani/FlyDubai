# FlyDubai

This app was developed by me and my team members at FlyDubai Hackathon held at T-Hub, IIIT, Hyderabad.

The app has two modules
- First Module is for first time flight travellers. This module provides step by step slides for all the important instructions and all the tasks that are to be done at airport till finaly reaching seat in flight.
- Second module provides an static implementation of flight booking system with some ideas about offers that can be provided to customer for their convinience. The emergency phone number provided in booking will recieve text messages about all the updates, like passenger have booked of ticket, reached airport, boarded flight, reached destination, etc.
